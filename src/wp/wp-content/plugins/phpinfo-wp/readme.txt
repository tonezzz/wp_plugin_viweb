A simple plugin to look up server info and manage server configuration of wordpress site

== Description ==

A simple wordpress plugin to look up information about server and PHP's configuration and manage server configurations.

This plugin gives a large amount of information about the current state of PHP. This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of configuration options, HTTP headers. For making information concise, PHP license has been removed.

You can see what extensions are enabled in your server through this plugin. Except these, you can edit or set Server configuration values like max_file_uploads, upload_max_filesize, etc. You can edit or set any directive values through this plugin easily.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the requirements to active this plugin? =

Nothing is needed. But sometimes, hosting providers disable [server setting](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.disable-functions). In that case, you need to contact with your hosting provider
See screenshot #1. Make sure site's root directory is writable to set or edit server configuration's directive values. 

= Why my site is showing Internal Server Error 500 after editing .htaccess file? =

Relax, nothing has happend. Safe edit feature for editing .htaccess file has been added from version 2.0. In case you are using older version than 2.0. Don't worry. Enter to your hosting site. Go to File Manager. Edit .htaccess file which is located at the root folder of you site's directory. Delete the code which is faulty. Save and site will be ok.
